The_Missing_Characters
======================
A Python-solution to the [Missing Characters-challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-missing-characters) on Hackerrank. The solution is largely based on Peter Norvig's [21-line Python-spelling corrector](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html). The corpus is compressed and serialized with the `compress_corpus.py`-script. The serialized corpus-dictionary is then pasted into the `The_Missing_Characters.py`-submission script.
